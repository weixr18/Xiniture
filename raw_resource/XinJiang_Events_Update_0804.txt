SIK.0.d = Bingtuan has played important role in the governing of Xinjiang. It takes care of both internal and external security -  separatist groups and infiltrators are always major concerns since the first days of China governance. It also plays the role of merging the culture and economical gap between Xinjiang and the eastern part of China: intellectuals and workers immigrated from eastern China brings industrialization and modernization to this northwestern province. Even Bingtuan is mostly self-sufficient on economy, the poor nature conditions in Xinjiang prevents Bingtuan to produce more. Now that the state of economy is not looking good all over the country, some argues for the dissolution of Bingtuan so its members can join the development of more prosperous areas at a higher efficiency.

SIK.601.d = Since we chose Cyrillic alphabet for Orthography, an decrease in USSR infiltrators found by our intelligence agency was reported. It could be a whiff in the air, or means some infiltrators have escaped our notice. 
SIK.601.a = Strengthen border patrol and internal security!

SIK.602.d = Local officials reported that some groups are spreading separatist sentiment by spreading separatist and Pan-Turkism Arabic articles of foreign source. The Arabic orthography makes Pan-Turkism more popular in the masses.
SIK.602.a = Put censorship on Arabic and Uyghur publication!
SIK.602.b = It is of little concern.

SIK.603.d = The Latinization of signs and publications is mostly done in urban areas now. Still, much of the rural areas are still using traditional scripts. We can hurry the project so only latinized Uyghur will be needed in the future, or pause the project as some argues it will preserve Uyghur culture.
SIK.603.a = We have to done it thoroughly. Leave no gap between cities and countryside!
SIK.603.b = We should halt this project.

SIK.604.t = Local resistance of Chinese!
SIK.604.d = In the process of substituting Uyghur with Chinese, we meet some resistance. Some local teachers themselves are not fluent with Chinese and general efficiency of society has decreased due to low language difficulties. We may now force this process at the risk of social instability, or take a milder stance at the cost of efficiency.
SIK.604.a = Force the issue! There is no turning back.
SIK.604.b = Use moderate ways, there is no need to hurry.
